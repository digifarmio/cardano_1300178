# Integration Roadmap for NMKR, Vault3, and DigiFarm

This document summarizes the key integrations and documentation related to the collaboration between NMKR, Vault3, and DigiFarm. The integrations have been defined and documented in detail, with the technical framework available in the attached PDF (in the Gdrive workspace) and supporting deliverables.

---

## Overview

The integration roadmap outlines:

- **Technical Infrastructure & Framework:**  
  The overall integration points between DigiFarm’s APIs and NMKR’s systems have been defined and are detailed in the technical framework document (PDF attached in the Gdrive workspace).

- **Data Deliverables:**  
  NMKR has successfully tested an offline [CSV File](../src/DigiFarm_NMKR_previews.csv) that contains:
  - Unique properties per field boundary
  - Digital identities of the associated agricultural land

- **Roles & Responsibilities:**  
  The responsibilities for each partner and their respective team members (from both DigiFarm and NMKR) are clearly documented in an accompanying Excel document. This document supports the technical integrations by outlining the assignments and validating the integration responsibilities.

## Integration Components

### Technical Infrastructure & Framework
- **Documentation:**  
  A [detailed PDF](./DigiFarm%20Cardano%20System%20Architecture.pdf) is available outlining:
  - Integration points between NMKR, Vault3, and DigiFarm
  - Data flow and system architecture

### CSV File Deliverable
- **Key Features:**  
  - Contains unique properties for each field boundary
  - Incorporates digital identity information for agricultural land
  - Has been validated through offline testing by NMKR

### API Integrations
- **DigiFarm’s APIs:**  
  - Detailed API specification [available here](https://digifarming.readme.io/reference/get_delineated-fields)
  - API Sandbox [available here] (https://api-docs.digifarm.io/#13/60.74627/11.18047)
  - Enable seamless data exchange with NMKR
  - Support the technical infrastructure as outlined in the framework document

## Next Steps

- **Review & Update:**  
  Ongoing updates to the integration documentation will be made as project milestones progress.
- **Verification:**  
  Regular checks will ensure that the API integrations and CSV deliverables continue to meet the project’s technical requirements.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Continuous communication between DigiFarm and NMKR is maintained to ensure alignment and effective execution of integration tasks.
