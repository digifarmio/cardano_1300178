## 2. CSV File for Data Tokenisation

  

-  **Description:**

A [CSV file](src/DigiFarm_NMKR_previews.csv) designed to support the deliverables by including structured data layers, which detail the digital field boundaries and associated crop performance data.

-  **Key Features:**

- Contains comprehensive data required for NFT tokenisation

- Supports integration with the technical workflow for data processing

- Serves as a critical input for automated minting processes
